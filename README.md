mario_2_example
===============

A little part of Super Mario Bros. 2 game with Flash / ActionScript 3 (from scratch).

This is a game I liked a lot when I was a kid, and with the princess you could fly far away because of her skirt :D (unfortunately this version doesn't have this effect).

It's short and a bit buggy, it was just to get a feeling how to do a game like this with Actionscript.
